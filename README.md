# Business Site

This project involves the development of a business one-pager website aimed at learning and showcasing the fundamental principles of HTML forms. The focus is on understanding the various form elements and how they work together to capture user input.

The website will feature:

Form elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and buttons.
A minimalist design using basic CSS to provide clear and simple styling.
The form will send data to a mock server for testing purposes, demonstrating how data is submitted and processed in real-world applications.
This project serves as an introduction to building interactive web pages and understanding how form data can be handled in HTML, developed through collaboration to combine different perspectives and skills.
